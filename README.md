## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Import/Export (javascript S6)


### What I learned

In the project I learned the use of type modules in javascript, Because with it I can separate functions bys modules, making project maintenance easier! 

Bellow is an example:

```html
<body>

<script type="module" src="./assets/js/script.js"></script>

</body>
```

```js
export function initMenuMobile(){
	....
}


```

```js
import {initMenuMobile} from "./modules/menuMobile.js";

initMenuMobile();


```

## Acknowledgments

I wnat to thank God for giving me wisdom and in the moments I struggled(lol) he gave me solace in my heart and mind to calm down and tink about how to finish the project!

I'm very happy with my commitment, it may seem simples to some people but for me it's the feeling that I gave my best!
